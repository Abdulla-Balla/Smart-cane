# Smart Cane for the Visually and Elderly Impaired

## Problem Statement

Visually impaired and elderly individuals often struggle to navigate environments independently and safely. Traditional walking canes do not provide obstacle detection or guidance. This project addresses that gap by developing a smart, sensor-equipped cane that enhances user safety, autonomy, and mobility through real-time feedback.

## Abstract

The Smart Cane is an innovative assistive device designed to help users detect nearby obstacles using ultrasonic sensors and buzzers. Each sensor corresponds to a direction (front, left, right), and buzzers provide sound-based alerts with unique patterns to help the user understand where the obstacle is. This allows safer navigation, especially in unfamiliar or cluttered spaces. The device is built using Arduino and low-cost, readily available components, and the frame is made of lightweight aluminum. Designed with empathy and function in mind, the cane offers an affordable and practical solution to a real-world problem.

## Research and Innovation

- Investigated how ultrasonic sensors can measure proximity accurately in various environments.
- Used feedback from potential users and educators to iterate on sound patterns and ergonomics.
- Designed a durable structure using aluminum, based on research and EGA competition requirements.
- Explored advanced materials like graphene for future versions, though not used in the current prototype.

##  Challenges and Solutions

During development, one challenge was managing sensor interference, especially with multiple ultrasonic modules operating simultaneously. This was solved by sequencing the distance readings in code with slight delays. Another issue was balancing power and size; choosing a small, efficient power bank resolved this without adding weight. Lastly, the team debated adding Bluetooth for IoT/cloud features, but ultimately chose to prioritize local functionality to maintain simplicity and usability for elderly users.

##  Future Enhancements

- Add Bluetooth connectivity for mobile app integration.
- Include GPS and emergency SMS functionality.
- Use vibration motors for silent feedback in noisy areas.
- Explore lightweight graphene materials for next-generation prototypes.
