# Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired

A smart ultrasonic-based walking cane designed to assist visually impaired and elderly individuals with safe navigation through obstacle detection and audio feedback.

---

## üß† Abstract

This project focuses on the development of an affordable smart cane that supports visually impaired and elderly individuals in detecting obstacles and navigating safely. The cane utilizes ultrasonic sensors positioned at the front, left, and right to detect nearby objects. Each sensor is linked to a buzzer that provides intuitive audio feedback: continuous, fast, or slow beeping to indicate the direction and distance of obstacles. The simplicity of the system ensures ease of use, and the use of sound provides effective guidance in real time.

## üîç Research Background

Navigating independently is one of the greatest daily challenges faced by blind or visually impaired individuals. Traditional canes do not offer information about obstacles above ground level or on the sides. Our research aimed to address this limitation using a simple microcontroller-based system with real-time obstacle detection and non-visual feedback.

Ultrasonic sensors were chosen due to their cost-effectiveness, reliability, and ease of integration. Studies on assistive devices confirm that audible feedback is among the most accessible alert methods for those who cannot rely on haptic or visual systems.

## üéØ Objectives

- To assist the visually impaired and elderly in independently navigating environments.
- To provide intuitive, real-time obstacle alerts through distinct audio signals.
- To build a reliable, low-cost, and easy-to-use assistive device.
- To reduce collisions and improve safety using non-contact sensing.

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Visually impaired individuals face constant risk from unseen obstacles in public and private spaces, especially when relying solely on traditional canes. The lack of directional awareness about surrounding hazards (especially from the sides) reduces their mobility and independence. There is a need for a more intelligent, responsive cane that can detect obstacles and communicate them effectively to the user.

## üí° Concept Overview

The smart cane includes:
- **Three ultrasonic sensors** (front, left, right) for full-direction obstacle coverage.
- **Three buzzers** that emit distinct sound patterns based on obstacle direction.
- A **microcontroller (Arduino)** to process sensor data and activate the buzzers accordingly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Final Design Summary

The cane is equipped with three ultrasonic sensors:
- **Front Sensor**: Triggers a continuous beep when an object is ahead.
- **Left Sensor**: Emits fast short beeps for left-side obstacles.
- **Right Sensor**: Emits slower, longer beeps for right-side hazards.

The buzzers are triggered when obstacles are within a critical distance threshold (~50 cm). The entire setup is lightweight and can run on battery for portable use.

## üß™ Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Differentiating obstacle direction in a simple way  
  **Solution:** Used distinct buzzer frequencies and patterns for each direction.

- **Challenge:** Power supply portability  
  **Solution:** Integrated a rechargeable power bank to avoid reliance on wall power.

- **Challenge:** Sensor placement on the cane  
  **Solution:** Designed a layout with optimized sensor angles using Fusion 360 for CAD modeling.

## üíª Code Overview

The Arduino code controls:
- Distance measurement using ultrasonic sensors.
- Tone signals using `tone()` and `noTone()` functions for the buzzers.
- Serial monitor for debugging and reading real-time distances.

## üìê CAD & Mechanical Design

CAD designs were created using **Fusion 360** to model sensor holders and the component layout on the cane. The design ensures that components are safely embedded and do not obstruct user movement.

## üåê IoT / Cloud Integration (Optional)

Though not implemented in this version, future iterations could integrate **Bluetooth or Wi-Fi modules** (such as ESP32 or HC-05) to send sensor data to a mobile app for:
- Fall detection alerts
- Real-time location tracking
- Obstacle history

This was not included due to practical power and cost limitations, keeping the device simple and offline-first.

## üìå Future Improvements

- Add **vibration motors** for silent feedback mode.
- Integrate **GPS** for location tracking.
- Design a **companion mobile app** using Bluetooth.
- Implement **voice feedback** using text-to-speech modules.
