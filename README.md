# Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired

## Abstract

The Smart Cane is an assistive device designed to help visually impaired and elderly individuals navigate their surroundings safely and independently. Using ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in front, to the left, and to the right, the cane alerts the user through distinct audio signals using buzzers. The design emphasizes affordability, portability, and simplicity, making it accessible to users without requiring internet connectivity or complex training. Built around an Arduino Uno, the project showcases how simple electronics and thoughtful design can significantly enhance mobility and quality of life for users.

## Problem Statement

Visually impaired individuals face challenges in independently navigating their environment due to the inability to detect obstacles ahead or to the sides. Traditional white canes provide limited spatial awareness and no proactive warning system for collisions. There is a need for a low-cost, intelligent mobility aid that can alert users to nearby hazards using non-visual signals to reduce accidents and enhance personal autonomy.
